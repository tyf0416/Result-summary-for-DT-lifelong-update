Test run #   ----		Random seed for inital DT 	---		Random seed for update
	2 							100									100
-------------------------------------------------
It contains results that used for comparison studies.

Test run #: 1

Tested problems to save running time:
	1. Battery discharging
	2. Engine p21 (p1 in the paper)

Comparison studies:
	1. Comparison of time-series forecasting method -- AE-Transformer per model
	2. Effects of dependencies among DT model hidden layers -- AE-LSTM per layer
	3. Comparison of feature extraction method -- POD-LSTM per model
